	Abstract = {Considers the need to have a set of indicators for measuring democracy that are reliable across diverse societies. The puzzling outcomes generated by some indicators when they cross borders are described. Results of the 2001 & 2006 Asian Barometer Surveys (ABSs) are analyzed to show that people have different notions of the meaning of democracy. A support for democracy sometimes indicates how respondents want to be perceived by others rather than whether they understand what democracy is. It is contended that researchers should never rely on a single indicator to measure democratic legitimacy across nations & should "cross-examine the validity of all indicators based on the word `democracy'." ABS's inclusion of other attitudinal dimensions & an additive battery of questions to investigate the substance/depth of a respondent's commitment to democracy is examined. Both measurements are combined to produce a "typology of democratic orientation" that describes four distinct types from "Consistent democrats" to "Superficial democrats." An analysis of the results across 13 Asian countries shows that the typology resolves problems resulting from inconsistent understandings of democracy. J. Lindroth},

	Abstract = {Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.},

@article{King2001,
	Abstract = {We propose a remedy for the discrepancy between the way political scientists analyze data with missing values and the recommendations of the statistics community. Methodologists and statisticians agree that "multiple imputation" is a superior approach to the problem of missing data scattered through one's explanatory and dependent variables than the methods currently used in applied data analysis. The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.},

@article{Monogan2015,
	Abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACT            This article describes the current debate on the practice of preregistration in political science‚{\"A}{\^\i}that is, publicly releasing a research design before observing outcome data. The case in favor of preregistration maintains that it can restrain four potential causes of publication bias, clearly distinguish deductive and inductive studies, add transparency regarding a researcher‚{\"A}{\^o}s motivation, and liberate researchers who may be pressured to find specific results. Concerns about preregistration maintain that it is less suitable for the study of historical data, could reduce data exploration, may not allow for contextual problems that emerge in field research, and may increase the difficulty of finding true positive results. This article makes the case that these concerns can be addressed in preregistered studies, and it offers advice to those who would like to pursue study registration in their own work. },

@article{Newman2015,
	Abstract = {Existing research analyzes the effects of cross-national and temporal variation in income inequality on public opinion; however, research has failed to explore the impact of variation in inequality across citizens' local residential context. This article analyzes the impact of local inequality on citizens' belief in a core facet of the American ethos---meritocracy. We advance conditional effects hypotheses that collectively argue that the effect of residing in a high-inequality context will be moderated by individual income. Utilizing national survey data, we demonstrate that residing in more unequal counties heightens rejection of meritocracy among low-income residents and bolsters adherence among high-income residents. In relatively equal counties, we find no significant differences between high- and low-income citizens. We conclude by discussing the implications of class-based polarization found in response to local inequality with respect to current debates over the consequences of income inequality for American democracy.},
