\section{Wrangle Data with Care}

need to be really careful: double-check!  Also need to be transparent.

merging: data on Bush share of vote don't match

As shown in Table~\ref{T:bush_al}, a quick glance at the first handful of counties analyzed in Table 1 and Table 2 \citep{Newman2015} reveals that something went wrong when information on the Bush share of the vote in the 2004 election was merged into the datasets: across all counties examined in both tables, fewer than 10\% have matching data, even when rounded to two decimal places.  (The data analyzed in Table 1 correspond that available from other sources, so it appears that it is the Table 2 dataset that is problematic.)

coding and recoding: NJL's five point party id scale collapses leaners and weak partisans (not weak and strong partisans, and not leaners and `true' independents).  Should really use the full seven point scale; no reason to throw away that information (or to deviate from common practice)

unemployment is mismeasured in 2005, 2007, and 2009 in Table 1 due to missing employ2 variable---all of those who are not working (students, retired, etc.) are coded as unemployed
