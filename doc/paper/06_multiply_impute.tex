\section{Multiply Impute Missing Data}

missing data should be multiply imputed \citep[e.g.,][]{King2001}

church attendance---all missing are simply assigned "once or twice a month"

unemployment is mismeasured in 2005 (+2007/2009) due to missing employ2 variable---all of those who are not working (students, retired, etc.) are coded as unemployed

income, a variable of interest, is missing for over 10\% of the sample, but values are mysteriously single-imputed (where did these values come from?)
