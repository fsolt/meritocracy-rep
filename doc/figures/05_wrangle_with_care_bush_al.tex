		  the share of the vote won by Bush in the 2004 presidential election.  
		  The first six counties, when listed alphabetically by state and 
		  county, are shown; they reveal that the data employed in Table 2
		  only occasionally matches that employed in Table 1, even when
		  rounded to two digits.  Overall, these data match for fewer than
