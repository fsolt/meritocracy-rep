Ensure Reproducibility

What is reproducibility? Reproducibility means that Researcher B obtains exactly the same results that were originally reported by Researcher A (e.g. the author of that paper) from Aâ€™s data when following the same methodology (Brunswik 1955; Asendorpf et al. 2013). 
Also, even for replicability, this paper is problematic. Replicability means that the finding can be obtained with other random samples drawn from a different time point or a different situation. As we will show as follows, they employed one survey that can especially strengthen their arguments and did not try to test whether their findings can be generalized to other time points and other situations. 

Why reproducibility is important.
How the present social science could develop so far based on the replication work. Examples.
Using multiple measures for the dependent variable.
